              Kl'rt was a member of the Skrulls race. Years before he became the
              Super-Skrull, he was a decorated soldier in the Skrull army. This
              led a wealthy Skrullian countess from the planet Zaragz'na to be
              betrothed to him.[21] He spawned two children, a son, Sarnogg,[17]
              and a daughter, Jazinda.[18] Kl'rt favored his son and despised
              his daughter.[20] However, Kl'rt's duty and devotion as a soldier
              kept him away from his family, most notably when he fought in the
              Battle of Harkoon.[17][21] However, after a string of defeats, the
              disgraced Kl'rt was turned away by his mate, banished from
              Z'aragz'na, and was no longer allowed to see his son. Over the
              years Kl'rt secretly kept tabs on his old life.[21]
            </p>
            <p>
              When Jazinda grew to adulthood she sought to win her father's
              respect and joined the Skrull army herself. While on a mission to
              recover the Sy-Torak Gem from the Kree empire, she was caught in
              the act. She swallowed the gem and it permanently bonded to her
              body. Discovering that she could not die with the gem in her
              system, and that its removal would kill her, Jazinda went into
              hiding. This failed mission put shame upon Kl'rt's home and he
              vowed to one day find his daughter and kill her for the disgrace
              she put upon their family.[20] Meanwhile, Sarnogg underwent his
              first hunt, an event which Kl'rt witnessed from a distance as he
              was not allowed to attend.[21]
            </p>
            <p>
              Under the rule of Emperor Dorrek VII, Kl'rt became the first
              Super-Skrull. He was endowed with the powers of the Fantastic Four
              and sent to Earth to conquer it after the Fantastic Four thwarted
              their previous invasion attempt.[22] With powers that were
              stronger than his foes', the Super-Skrull was more than a match
              against the Fantastic Four. The team's leader, Mr. Fantastic,
              deduced that Kl'rt's powers were artificial and beamed to him from
              the Skrull throneworld, so he built a jamming device that cut off
              the Super-Skrull's power source. Powerless, Kl'rt was imprisoned
              inside a dormant volcano.[2]
            </p>
            <p>
              Still seeking revenge against the Fantastic Four, Dorrek had his
              scientists boost the transmission signal, allowing the
              Super-Skrull to break free of the volcano months later. Under
              orders, Kl'rt took the place of Franklin Storm, father of the
              Fantastic Four's Invisible Girl and Human Torch. At the time,
              Franklin was serving time in prison for vehicular manslaughter.
              Posing as Franklin, the Super-Skrull broke out of jail and
              fashioned the identity of the "Invincible Man", using his
              "familial" connection to the Fantastic Four to force them to hold
              back while he committed a crime spree. However, noticing that
              their foe replicated all their powers, Reed correctly deduced that
              the Invincible Man was really the Super-Skrull in disguise. Reed
              then constructed a weapon and threatened to destroy the Skrull
              Throneworld unless Dorrek agreed to cease his hostilities. The
              Super-Skrull was teleported back to his homeworld and Franklin
              Storm was returned. However, the Skrulls planned a double-cross as
              they had planted a bomb on Franklin to destroy the Fantastic Four.
              Franklin instead sacrificed his life, shielding the FF from the
              blast, saving their lives and dying a hero.[23]

              When Mr. Fantastic and the Invisible Girl were to be married,
              their old foe Dr. Doom created an Emotion Changer device and used
              it to draw in an army of super-villains to attack the wedding.
              Among those who were drawn in for the attack was the Super-Skrull.
              Kl'rt failed to get close to the wedding as his ship was destroyed
              by the Asgardian thunder god Thor[24] who then defeated him in
              hand-to-hand combat.[25] Ultimately the Super-Skrull and the other
              villains were sent away by Mr. Fantastic who was given a Time
              Displacer device by the Watcher which shunted all their foes back
              in time to prior to the attack and with no memory of what
              happened.[24][25] That Christmas Eve, the Super-Skrull made yet
              another attack on the Fantastic Four, this time while they were
              celebrating Christmas at their headquarters in the Baxter
              Building. Although details pertaining to this battle are minimal,
              Kl'rt was easily defeated and likely escaped.[26] For his past
              failures the Super-Skrull was put on patrol duty. It was here that
              he was manipulated by the Asgardian trickster god Loki. Under
              Loki's influence, Kl'rt returned to Earth to attack Thor. Thor
              proved to be more than a match for the Super-Skrull, and using his
              enchanted hammer Mjolnir created "anti-force" rays to send him out
              of Earth's orbit, with a warning to stay away from Earth in the
              future.[27]
